}
\arguments{
\item{wd}{Working directory with data (`mixed_train.csv`, `mixed_test.csv` and `mixed_validation.csv` as created by `OmicSelector_prepare_split` have to be present).}

\item{m}{Methods of feature selection to be performed. This has to be a vector of integers with minimum of 1 and maximum of 70. For the definition of numbers please see the vignette.}

\item{max_iterations}{Maximum number of iterations in selected methods. Setting this too high may results in very long comupting time.}

\item{code_path}{A folder where the python external scripts are placed (especially for WxNet method). By default the additional code is provided in the package.}

\item{register_parallel}{Where to use parallel processing to speed up computing time. Seting it to FALSE may aid in debuging.}

\item{clx}{This parameter may be used for passing the already register computing cluster (created and registered with `doParallel` tools). This may lower the computing time by saving the time to register new cluster.}

\item{stamp}{A character vector or timestamp used for marking the output files.}

\item{prefer_no_features}{Maximum number of miRNAs that can be selected by the tools if the method allows for that.}

\item{conda_path}{Patch to "conda" bindary used for executing python scripts.}

\item{debug}{Gives additional debug information (saves .rdata after feature selection is completed, prints formulas to log)}

\item{timeout_sec}{Timeout after the method is terminated if not finished. It may be useful to keep the long methods limited, not to wait ethernity for the results.}

\item{type}{Parameter 'mode' forwarded to OmicSelector_differential_expression_ttest which is essential in many feature selection methods. Note that if 'var_type.txt' file exists in the working directory it is superior to the value set directly in function - as designed for GUI. Please refer to OmicSelector_differential_expression_ttest manual to understand how 'mode' worOmicSelector_}

\value{
The list of selected formulas. Note that, due to purpose of this package `OmicSelector_merge_formulas` may be a better option to get the output of processes run by this function.

\description{
Main function of the package. The aim of this function is to perform feature selection using multiple methods and to create formulas for benchmarking.
It loads the data from working directory. The output is mainly created in files in working directory. Log and temporary files are placed in created `temp` subfolder.
This package offers about 60 feature selection methods. Which methods will be check by this function is defined by `m` parameter.
