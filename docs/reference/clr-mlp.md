# CLR + MLP Models for Within-Sample Classification

Implements centered log-ratio (CLR) transforms and dense neural-network
classifiers for within-sample biomarker panel classification. On
log-scale inputs the CLR transform is a simple within-sample centering
operation, making it invariant to uniform additive shifts applied to all
features of a sample.
